# Image-Processing-for-Clean-vs-Dirty-Surface

This is a project that mainly focuses on developing a system to automatically distinguish between clean and dirty floors through image processing techniques. 

In this repository I have provided the code file along with the dataset I have trained.
Lastly, I have attached few outputs to sho the work.
